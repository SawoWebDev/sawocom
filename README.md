## 🚀 Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

---

## 📜 Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in development mode.  
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes, and you may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in interactive watch mode.  
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests).

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.  
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes performance.

The build is minified and filenames include hashes.  
Your app is ready to be deployed!

Learn more about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment).

### `npm run eject`

> **Note:** This is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!

This will copy all configuration files (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc.) into your project so you can fully customize them.
